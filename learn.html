                <div class="faq-question">How often should I service my HVAC system?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">	You should service your HVAC system twice a year—once in the spring for air conditioning and once in the fall for heating. Regular maintenance helps improve efficiency, prevent breakdowns, and extend the lifespan of your system. During a tune-up, a technician will inspect and clean components, check refrigerant levels, test electrical connections, lubricate moving parts, and replace or clean air filters. Routine service can also lower energy bills and improve indoor air quality. Schedule your maintenance today to keep your system running at its best.</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How long does an HVAC system last?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">An HVAC system typically lasts between 12 to 15 years, but its lifespan depends on factors like maintenance, usage, and system quality. Regular tune-ups, timely repairs, and changing air filters can help extend its life. Air conditioners and heat pumps usually last around 10 to 15 years, while furnaces can last 20 years or more with proper care. If your system is over 15 years old, needs frequent repairs, or isn’t heating or cooling efficiently, it may be time to consider a replacement. Upgrading to a newer system can improve energy efficiency and lower utility costs.</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How can I improve my HVAC system’s efficiency?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">You can improve your HVAC system’s efficiency by keeping up with regular maintenance, changing air filters every one to three months, and ensuring your vents are clean and unblocked. Sealing air leaks around doors and windows, using a programmable thermostat, and keeping your ducts clean can also help reduce energy waste. Setting your thermostat to an energy-efficient temperature and using ceiling fans to circulate air can ease the workload on your system. If your HVAC unit is older, upgrading to a high-efficiency model can significantly lower energy bills and improve performance.</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">How often should I change my AC filter?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">You should change your AC filter every one to three months, depending on factors like usage, indoor air quality, and whether you have pets or allergies. Homes with pets or allergy sufferers may need more frequent changes to maintain clean air and system efficiency. A clogged filter restricts airflow, forcing your HVAC system to work harder, which can lead to higher energy bills and potential breakdowns. Regularly replacing your filter helps improve air quality, keeps your system running efficiently, and extends its lifespan.</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Why is my AC not cooling properly?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">If your AC isn’t cooling properly, it could be due to several reasons. A dirty or clogged air filter can restrict airflow, making it harder for your system to cool effectively. Low refrigerant levels from a leak or improper charge can also impact performance. A malfunctioning thermostat, dirty coils, or blocked vents and ducts may be causing inefficiency. In some cases, the issue could be with the compressor or other internal components. If your system is running but not cooling, it’s best to have a professional diagnose the problem to prevent further damage and restore comfort.</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Are HVAC maintenance plans worth it?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">Yes, HVAC maintenance plans are worth it because they help keep your system running efficiently, reduce the risk of breakdowns, and extend the lifespan of your equipment. With a maintenance plan, you receive regular tune-ups, which can improve performance, lower energy bills, and catch small issues before they turn into costly repairs. Many plans also include priority service, discounts on repairs, and waived service fees, adding extra value. If you want peace of mind knowing your HVAC system is well-maintained year-round, a maintenance plan is a smart investment.</div>

                <div class="faq-question">How much does a new HVAC system cost?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">The cost varies, typically ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 depending on the system and installation.</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Why is my HVAC system making noise?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">If your HVAC system is making noise, it could be due to a few common issues. Buzzing or humming sounds could be caused by an electrical issue, such as a loose connection or a failing capacitor. Rattling or banging noises may indicate loose parts or debris in the system, like a loose fan or a broken belt. Squealing sounds often point to a problem with the blower motor or a worn-out fan belt. Grinding noises are typically a sign of motor failure. In any case, if your HVAC system is making unusual noises, it's best to have a professional inspect it to identify and fix the issue before it leads to a breakdown.</div>
